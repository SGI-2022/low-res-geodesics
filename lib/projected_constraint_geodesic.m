  % Computes the geodesic distance to any member of a target set of

      % Basically: |Î”D| <= 1
      % Note: Gradient is really a tensor, and this call to reshape is
      % makes it behave like a tensor product which spits out a vector 
      % for each face. Then we take the norm of that vector, and this is
      % the quantityt we want to restict to be less than 1.
