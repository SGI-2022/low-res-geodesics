function Distance = smart_boundary_geodesic(Verts, Faces, TargetVerts, Basis)
  % Computes the geodesic distance to any member of a target set of

  % Compute the compute the 1 ring of each vertex
  Vring = compute_vertex_ring(Faces);

  % Construct minimum-distance information around the target verticies
  NeighborEdgeDist = zeros(NumVerts, 1);

  % Note: There may be a vectorized way to do this, but I'm not sure 
  % what it is.
  % First, iterate over all the target verticies
  for I = 1:length(TargetVerts)
    % Then iterate over the ring of surrounding verticies
    Neighbors = Vring(TargetVerts(I));
    Neighbors = Neighbors{1}; % GPToolbox returns this in a weird format that we have to unwrap

      EdgeDist = norm(Verts(TargetVerts(I)) - Verts(Neighbors(J)));
      % If its shorter than the current value, use the new distance
      if NeighborEdgeDist(Neighbors(J)) == 0 || EdgeDist < NeighborEdgeDist(Neighbors(J))
        NeighborEdgeDist(Neighbors(J)) = EdgeDist;

      % makes it behave like a tensor product which spits out a vector
